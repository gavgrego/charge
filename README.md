### Charge - Credit Card Expense Management for Couples

Built with NextJS and Strapi, in conjunction w/ Turborepo. Leveraging TanStack Query/Table and ShadCN, among others.

Right now only works with Amex exports, will support other card issuers eventually.

Dockerfile for postgres DB coming soon.

Run yarn dev in root folder to start both Next and Strapi via Turborepo.
